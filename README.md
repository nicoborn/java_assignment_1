Project: Java Assignment 1 by N. Born and M. Marchese

# Description
Aircraft manager is a java tool that lets you add / edit / delete aircrafts.
At the first start a sample fie "aircraft.data" will be created with an example aircraft in it.

# Special remarks
Instead of saving the data of the aircrafts at the time the program closes, we have decided to solve this by user input (button click for add, edit, and so on).
This allows for real time data verification.

# How to use?
Show aircraft
By clicking on an aircraft in the list, the information will appear in the form on the left.
You can also iterate through the list by the arrow keys (up/down).

## Add aircraft
If you want to add an aircraft to the database, please click on the "+" button bellow the list of aircrafts.
The entry form will now be available to you and you can add an aircraft. After filling all information needed, please click the "Add" button below the form.

## Edit aircraft
If you want to edit an aircraft click on an entry in the list and click "Edit selected"
The form will now be available to change data. After editing please click the "Save" button below the form.

## Delete aircraft
If you want to delete an aircraft click on an entry in the list and click the "-" button below the list of aircrafts.
You will be asked to confirm your decision to delete an aircraft.
